All UIs should maintain a modern style based on text (black and white).

[Design Principles]

- Colors are primarily composed of black, white, and gray.
- Accent colors are available only upon request and are limited.
- The overall tone is harmonious and designed to fit the desired service (coupon/finance/platform).
- Avoid persistent decorative elements, excessive independence, or animatsion.

[Layout]

- Choose a Grid or Flexbox-based design.
- Structures that rely on padding and margins are unreliable.
- Card UIs are distinguished only by borders or subtle shadows.
- Mobile-first responsive design.

[Typography]

- System or sans-serif relationships.
- Headings are expressed in different font weights and sizes.
- Line height prioritizes readability (1.4 to 1.6).
- Induce psychological emphasis (color emphasis).

[Component Styles]

- Button: Edit Background + Edit Hover State
- Input Field: Border Highlight, Outline or Border Highlight on Focus
- State expressions are explained by icons, content, and length, rather than color
- All components are designed to be reusable.

[CSS Writing Rules]

- Use meaningful class naming (BEM or role-critical naming)
- Separate styles by their performance (CSS Variables)
- Write CSS with a maintainable structure
- Maintain code quality through actual service deployment
